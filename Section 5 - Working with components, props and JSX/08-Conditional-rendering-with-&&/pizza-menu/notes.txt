Q) Explain the && operator?

Q) Why does the footer renders nothing if falsy but if you use pizzas number as a comparison it 
returns false?

Q) Code:
- Make the open or closed show with conditional rendering
- Make it show the button and use the classes.
- Make the same for pizzas
- 

When the first expression on && is true it will automatically execute the second part. && Short circuits 
if the value is falsy. The result of the expression is true but React does not render true or false which is 
why it works.

Notice that you render the JSX inside the JS mode {}.

If you put the pizzas array size inside a variable and use that for conditional rendering it will return 0. That's 
because of short circuiting since it will ignore the expression and return the operation. It did not happen the same at 
footer because React does not render true or false.

To avoid errors always have a true or false condition.

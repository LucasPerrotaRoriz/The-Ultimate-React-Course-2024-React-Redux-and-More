Q) Code:

- Solve key issue
- Make the list be semantic

Rendering a list is when with an array you render a component for each element on the array. 

You can comment on React with {};

When rendering the list an error will occur saying you need to have a key on on props. This means that each item
that's rendered need to have a unique key property. The keys is internal to React and important for performance 
optimizations. 

You need to use map() instead of forEach() because map will create a new array and the ul needs the JSX.

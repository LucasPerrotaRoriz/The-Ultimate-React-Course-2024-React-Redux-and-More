Q) Code:
- Have a function called handleUndo to reset state of details and likes
- Log a message on function
- Log a message on handleUndo with a state
- Implement triple increment and log state
- Implement it now with a callback 
- Implement calling the method
- Have a callback on the +1 increment
- Implement the reset with the timer


handleUndo state updates are batched and cause one re-render. You can test this by logging a message each 
time the components is rendered. Two messages will appear but that is not related to re-rendering

If you click the undo button the log for the component does not show, only the state of the prop. That happens because the state of the props 
are at their default, so React did not update then because current state === new state. React will not even try to update the state and not re-render 
the component instance.

If you implement the triple increment and do to it you use three setLikes 3 times, it will not update the value to three, it will be one.
Since the state update is async every setLikes(likes + 1); like is equal 0, so all three do 0 + 1.

To fix this behavior you use a callback function. With the callback function you will get access to the latest updated state.

Remember and important thing that when you set state on the previous state or based on the current state, always use a callback function.

If you go back to React 17 and try undoing after 2s, there will be two renders.

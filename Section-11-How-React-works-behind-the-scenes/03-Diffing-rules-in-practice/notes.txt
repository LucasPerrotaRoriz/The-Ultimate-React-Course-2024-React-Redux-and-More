Q) Code:


If you hide the text or give some likes and then move to different tabs the values will remain.

Every time you click on the tab the component is re-rendered but in the component tree the it will be 
in the same position and since it stays on the same position it maintains it's state across renders. 

The TabContent component is not destroyed staying in the DOM, the props are the things changing.

If you click the forth tab, a new component is rendered and if you go back to the previous tabs the 
texts will show and the likes are changed because the states are reset.

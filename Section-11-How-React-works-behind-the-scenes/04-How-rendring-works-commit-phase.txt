----- The commit phase and browser paint

The list of DOM updates will then be used in the commit phase.

In this phase React writes to the DOM doing insertions,deletions and updates one by one. You may also hear that React flushes updates to the DOM in the commit 
phase.

Committing happens in one go and is synchronous and can't be stopped liked the render phase. It works like so the DOM does not show partial results ensuring 
consistency on the UI. 

The workInProgress tree becomes the current tree for the next render cycle. The browser will notice and change the UI based on the updates.

The render phase is done by React, the paint by a browsers like google,mozilla. The commit phase is done by a separate library called 
ReactDOM.

React never touches the DOM and does not know where the result is committed and painted. React was created like this to be separate from the platform
where element show, allowing React to be used by different hosts/renderers like android apps, videos, documents etc.
